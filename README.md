## Project Idea
A bicycle rack finding app using data from the City of Vancouver (as a starting point). I'm interested in doing this since my current solution to figuring out where to lock up my bike is using Google street view around the area I plan to go. As well, this app can incorporate other data such as user reported thefts and bike rack ratings to help gage whether you want to use a rack.

## User Stories
As a user I want to:
* view bikes racks on a map
* find the closest bike rack to a given location
* view the number of recent thefts for a bike rack
* view the rating of a bike rack
* report thefts from a bike rack
* report the addition/removal of bike racks
* submit a rating for a bike rack
